  - Sim
    - Tune so that disappearing landmarks track well
    - IMU biases dont track that well...???
  - Gazebo sim

PAPER
- Simulation 
- Unicycle Model
  - OR Car model?
- Sensors
  - IMU (accel + gyro)
  - CAMERA (feature points + aruco)
  - ?AHRSS attitude?
  - ?GPS position/velocity?
- Estimate
  - ?UAV position?
  - UAV velocity
  - ?UAV orientation?
  - LV Relative Position
  - LV Velocity
  - LV Orientation

TO GRADUATE
- Hardware landing with tag leaving FOV of camera

STEPS
- Simulation
  - land with tag staying in FOV
  - consistent estimates with tag not detected
  - land with losing tag intermitently
