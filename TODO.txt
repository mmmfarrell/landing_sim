TODO


DONE
- plot r vecs
- plot everything in inertial frame
- Account for UAV motion
  - UAV velocity sensor
  - use UAV attitude to rotate pixels to virtual image plane
- Add noise
  - Noise in pixel, depth, velocity are all fine
  - Noise in UAV attitude
    - OK with a little ~0.5 deg std dev
    - Not OK with more


BACKLOG
- Estimate UAV attitude & velocity as well
