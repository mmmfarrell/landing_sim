TODO
  - Estimate attitude
  - Use estimated attitude everywhere, true attitude nowhere
  - Lyx
  - code: using pixels, UAV velocity, angular rates, estimate landing vehicle

DONE
- plot r vecs
- plot everything in inertial frame
- Account for UAV motion
  - UAV velocity sensor
  - use UAV attitude to rotate pixels to virtual image plane
- Add noise
  - Noise in pixel, depth, velocity are all fine
  - Noise in UAV attitude
    - OK with a little ~0.5 deg std dev
    - Not OK with more

PAPER
- Simulation 
- Unicycle Model
  - OR Car model?
- Sensors
  - IMU (accel + gyro)
  - CAMERA (feature points + aruco)
  - ?AHRSS attitude?
  - ?GPS position/velocity?
- Estimate
  - ?UAV position?
  - UAV velocity
  - ?UAV orientation?
  - LV Relative Position
  - LV Velocity
  - LV Orientation

BACKLOG
- Estimate UAV velocity as well
